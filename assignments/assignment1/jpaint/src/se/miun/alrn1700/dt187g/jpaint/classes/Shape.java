/**
* An abstaction class for shapes.
* This class is abstract and can't be instantiated on its own, it needs to be subclassed by another class to use its properties.
*
* It implements the Drawable interface and therefore have to implement all of its abstract methods 
*   - (Drawable doesn't contain any default or static methods).
* 
* It defines both concrete (with implementation) and abstract methods (without implementation).
