/**
* An abstaction class for shapes.
* This class is abstract and can't be instantiated on its own, it needs to be subclassed by another class.
*
* It implements the Drawable interface and therefore have to implement all of its abstract methods 
*   - (Drawable doesn't contain any default or static methods).
* 
* The points array has a protected access modifier so that it can be accessed by its subclasses.
*
* It defines both concrete methods (with implementation - the getter & setter) and abstract methods (without implementation).
*
* The constructor initializes the color and the points array.
*   - The points array initializes with a size of 2 and the first element is set to the given point.
