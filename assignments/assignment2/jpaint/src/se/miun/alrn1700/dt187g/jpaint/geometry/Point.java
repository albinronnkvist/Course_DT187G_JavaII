/**
* A class which represents a Point in 2D space with x and y coordinates.
*
* The class uses encapsulation to hide the implementation details of the x and y coordinates.
*   - The instance variables are private and cannot be accessed from outside the class.
*   - It provides getter and setter methods to access and modify the private x and y coordinates.
*
* It has two constructors:
*   - A default constructor which sets the x and y coordinates to 0.
*     We have to explicitly define a default constructor, since we have another explicitly defined constructor, and a default constructor is not provided by the compiler in that case.
*   - A parameterized constructor which takes two arguments: x and y coordinates.
*
* It also overrides the toString() method to return a custom string representation of the point.
*   - All classes inherits from the Object class, which is where the default toString() method is defined.
