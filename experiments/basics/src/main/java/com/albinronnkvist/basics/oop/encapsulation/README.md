# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data.

Encapsulation is implemented by:
- Declaring the variables of a class as private.
- Providing public getter and setter methods to access and update the value of a private variable.
