# Dependency ("Uses a")

Dependency is a relationship where one class depends on another class to function. Itâ€™s a weaker form of association where one class temporarily uses another class.

## Examples:

- Class A uses Class B: If Class A depends on Class B, A relies on B for some function, but B is not a permanent part of A.
- Real-world analogy: A "Printer" class might depend on a "Document" class to print, meaning the printer uses the document.
