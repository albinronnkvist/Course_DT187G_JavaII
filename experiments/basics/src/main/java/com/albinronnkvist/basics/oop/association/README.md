# Association

Association represents a relationship where one class knows of or interacts with another class. This is the most general type of relationship and indicates that objects of one class can reference objects of another class.

## Examples

- Class A knows of Class B: An instance of Class A holds a reference to an instance of Class B.
- Real-world analogy: A "Teacher" class might know of a "Student" class, indicating that a teacher interacts with students.
