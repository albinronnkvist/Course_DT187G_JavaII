# Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features.

## Java Implementation

It can be achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces.

### Abstract classes

An abstract class is a class that can not be initiated by itself, it needs to be subclassed by another class to use its properties.

### Interfaces

An interface in Java is a reference type that defines a set of abstract methods (methods without implementation). 
Classes that implement an interface must provide implementations for these methods.
