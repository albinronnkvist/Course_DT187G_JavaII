# Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child class) can inherit fields and methods from another class (parent class). It represents an __"is a"__ relationship.

## Examples

- Class B is a Class A: If Class B inherits from Class A, then B is a specialized type of A.
- Real-world analogy: A "Dog" class might inherit from an "Animal" class, meaning that a dog is an animal.

## Java implementation

Inheritance is achieved using the `extends` keyword.
