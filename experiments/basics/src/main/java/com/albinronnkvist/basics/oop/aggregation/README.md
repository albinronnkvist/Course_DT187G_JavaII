# Aggregation ("Has a")

Aggregation is a type of association that represents a whole-part relationship where the part can exist independently of the whole. 
It shows that one class is composed of one or more instances of another class, but these instances can live on their own.

## Examples

- Class A has a Class B: If Class A has an aggregation relationship with Class B, then A is composed of B, but B can exist without A.
- Real-world analogy: A "Library" class might aggregate a "Book" class, where a library has books, but the books can exist independently of the library.
