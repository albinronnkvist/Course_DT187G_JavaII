# Aggregation

Aggregation is a special form of composition where the lifetime of the part is independent of the whole. It represents a "whole-part" relationship but with independent lifetimes.

Aggregation is implemented by including an instance of another class as a field, but with the understanding that the contained object can exist independently of the container.
